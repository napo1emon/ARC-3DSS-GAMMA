# ARC-3DSS-GAMMA
## Authentic Reticle Collection for 3D Shader Scopes for GAMMA

This is a small add-on for the phenomenal 3DSS mod â€“ I can't play GAMMA without it anymore. That said, I was less than satisfied with the default scope reticles, so I made a few for myself. The idea was to keep them as close to their real world counterparts as possible, so I did some research and came up with these. Also, I made some tweaks to the config files where I felt they were necessary (adding switchable illumination, first/second focal plane, magnification changes).

Feel free to post bugs, questions, suggestions. I have some updates planned.

**Installation:**
* Fomod included, you can pick what you like or leave the old stuff in place.
* Place this mod as low as possible in the load order, definitely below the main 3D Shader Scopes and any additional mods from the 3DSS family.
